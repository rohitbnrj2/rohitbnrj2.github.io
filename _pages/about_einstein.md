I am Robotics Master from [Michigan](https://robotics.umich.edu/) Ann Arbor, currently working in [Critical River](https://www.criticalriver.com/) as a Machine Learning Engineer. During my time at Michigan, I was fortunate to work under the guidance of Prof [David Fouhey](https://cs.nyu.edu/~fouhey/), Dr [Nilesh Kulkarni](https://nileshkulkarni.github.io/) and [Linyi Jin](https://jinlinyi.github.io/) on 3D Scene Generation from Single RGB Images.

Prior to Michigan, I was in UK working in the Railway and Automotive industries with [Siemens Mobility](https://www.mobility.siemens.com/uk/en/portfolio/rolling-stock.html) and [Jaguar Land Rover](https://www.jaguarlandrover.com/) respectively.

My research interests are primarily in 3D Computer Vision and Human-Object Interactions. Unfortunately, I am currently with LLMs on the lost cause of Text2SQL Generation to pay my bills (just joking). I see there is some future with Agentic Framework for structured use cases and am currently working to deploy real-world solutions to the accounting team of Doordash.
